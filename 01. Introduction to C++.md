# Introduction to C++

C++ is a programming language created by incorporating several features into the C language. It  introduces object-oriented concepts with the use of classes, making it a versatile programming language that supports templates for generic programming.

The following is a fundamental structure of a C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

## History of C++

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Laboratories, where the C language was also developed. In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup announced a new language named "C with Classes," where he added the concept of Simula, an object-oriented language, to the C language. Later, in 1984, with the introduction of the increment operator (++), the language was revised and renamed C++, signifying its status as an extended version of the C language.

C++98 marked the first standardized version of C++. It introduced many essential features that are still widely used today, including classes, templates, exceptions, and the Standard Template Library (STL). This version laid the foundation for the language's widespread adoption across various industries.In 2011, C++11 was released as a major update to the language, bringing new features and improvements, including lambda expressions, move semantics, range-based for loops, auto type inference, and smart pointers. C++17 was released in 2017 and introduced new features such as structured bindings, if constexpr, inline variables, and the optional and variant classes in the standard library."

## Namespace

In C++, a namespace is a feature that allows us to organize and group related code elements (such as variables, functions, and classes) under a unique identifier. This helps to prevent naming conflicts and provides a way to organize code in a modular and structured manner.

The standard components of C++ programs, such as classes, functions, and variables, are stored in a namespace called `std`. As a result, when using the definitions from the standard header file `iostream` in a C++ program, we must reference them as follows:
```cpp
std::cout << "Hello, World!";
```
To simplify the usage of definitions belonging to the `std` namespace, we can include the following statement:

```cpp
using namespace std;
```
By doing so, we can use definitions from the `std` namespace without explicitly attaching the namespace name. 
Therefore, the following code accomplishes the same operation as the previous one:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```
This approach is convenient when we frequently utilize elements from the `std` namespace, as it saves us from having to prefix each one with `std::`. However, it is essential to exercise caution when using `using namespace` directives, especially in large projects, as it may lead to potential naming conflicts if multiple namespaces are used. In such cases, it is recommended to selectively use the specific elements from the namespace or explicitly prefix them with the namespace name to avoid ambiguity.

## C++ Standard Library and `<iostream>`

C++ programs consist of pieces called classes and functions. We can program each piece that we may need to form a C++ program. Instead, most C++ programmers take advan-
tage of the rich collections of existing classes and functions in the **C++ Standard Library(STL)**.

Like the `printf()` function or `scanf()` function from the `<stdio.h>` header file in C language, C++ also defines the standard input/output class in the `<iostream>` header file which replaces the C++ Standard Library header file `<iostream.h>`. `iostream` contains function prototypes for the C++ standard input and standard output functions. In C++, we use the `cout` object for output and the `cin` object for input:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int num1, num2;
    int sum;
    cout << "Enter the first integer: ";
    cin >> num1;
    cout << "Enter the second integer: ";
    cin >> num2;
    sum = num1 + num2;
    cout << "The sum is " << sum << endl;
}
```
Here we first use the standard output stream object `std::cout`, and the *stream insertion operator* `<<` to display the string `"Enter first integer: "`. Output and input in C++ are accomplished with streams of characters. Thus, when `std::cout << "Enter the first integer: "` executes, it sends the stream of characters `"Enter first integer: "` to `std::cout`, which is normally *connected* to the screen. We like to describe this situation as `std::cout` gets the character string `"Enter first integer: "`. Next, we use the standard input stream object `std::cin`, and the *stream extraction operator* `>>` to obtain a value from the keyboard. Using the stream extraction operator with `std::cin` takes character input from the standard input stream, which is usually the keyboard. We like to describe this situation as, `std::cin` gives a value to `num1` or simply `std::cin` gives `num1`.

At the last line, we display the character string `"The sum is"` followed by the numerical variable `sum` followed by `std::endl`, a so-called *stream manipulator*. The name `endl` is an abbreviation for 'end line'. The `std::endl` stream manipulator outputs a newline, then *flushes the output buffer*. This simply means that, on some systems where outputs accumulate in the machine until there are enough to *make it worthwhile* to display on the screen, `std::endl` forces any accumulated outputs to be displayed at that moment. This can be important when the outputs are prompting the user for an action, such as entering data.

Compared to the C language's standard input/output functions `printf()` or `scanf()`, the C++ insertion operator (`<<`) and extraction operator (`>>`) are more intuitive as they represent the flow of data. Additionally, the C++ standard input/output object automatically converts the type of data, making it more convenient and safer.

## Standard keywords
Here is a list of standard keywords common to the C and C++ programming languages:
```cpp
auto        break       case        char        const
continue    default     do          double      else
enum        extern      float       for         goto
if          int         long        register    return
short       signed      sizeof      static      struct
switch      typedef     union       unsigned    void
volatile    while
```
Here is a list of standard keywords for C++ only:
```cpp
and         and_eq          asm         bitand              bitor
bool        catch           class       compl               const_cast
delete      dynamic_cast    explicit    export              false
friend      inline          mutable     namespace           new
not         not_eq          operator    or                  or_eq
private     protected       public      reinterpret_cast    static_cast
template    this            throw       true                try
typeid      typename        using       virtual             wchar_t
xor         xor_eq
```
