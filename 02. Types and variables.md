# Types and variables

## Variables for numbers

In C++, variables related to numeric expressions can be categorized into two main types: integer type variables and real number type variables. Integer type variables are further classified into four subtypes: `char`, `int`, `long`, and `long long` type variables. On the other hand, real number type variables are classified into two subtypes: `float` type and `double` type variables. These types are used to store decimal numbers with floating-point precision.

In addition to the built-in types, C++ also allows the creation of user-defined struct variables. Structs are used to group related data together, providing a way to process and manipulate them as a single unit.

## Constants

A constant, like a variable, is a memory space in which data can be stored. However, unlike variables, constants cannot change the data stored in memory while the program is running. In C++, constants can be divided into two types, literal constants and symbolic constants, according to how they are expressed.

### Literal Constants

A literal constant refers to a fixed value itself. In the example below, `int` is the data type, `num` is the name of a variable, and `10` is a literal constant.

```cpp
int num = 10;
```

A literal constant is precisely defined, leaving no room for interpretation. Unlike variables, literal constants do not have names that point to memory locations where data is stored. In C++, variables and constants must have a specified type to allocate appropriate memory space. C++ constants can be categorized into integer literal constants, real-type literal constants, and character-type literal constants based on their types.

The text is mostly clear, but there are a few minor grammar improvements that can be made. Here's the revised version:

#### Integer Literal Constants

Integer literal constants are represented directly by Arabic numerals and symbols, such as 123 and -456. In C++, integer constants can be expressed not only as decimal numbers but also as octal (starting with 0) or hexadecimal (starting with 0x) numbers. For the output of integer constants expressed in various bases, the `cout` object provides dec, hex, and oct modifiers. Passing these three modifiers to the `cout` object ensures that the format of the output digit remains unchanged until the user changes it again.

The following example outputs the number 10 in decimal, octal, and hexadecimal formats, respectively:

```cpp
int a = 10;
cout << "The number 10 in decimal: " << a << ", " << endl;

cout << oct;
cout << "The number 10 in octal: " << a << ", " << endl;

cout << hex;
cout << "The number 10 in hexadecimal: " << a << endl;
```

In C++, all integer literal constants are stored as type `int`, except for the following cases:

1. When the value of the data is too large to be stored as an `int` type.
2. In the case of directly specifying the type of the constant by using a suffix to an integer constant.

We can explicitly specify the type of a constant by adding a suffix to the end of the constant. The following table shows the integral types that can be represented by adding a suffix in C++.

| Suffix | Type                 |
|--------|----------------------|
| Default| (`signed`) `int` type    |
| `u` or `U` | `unsigned int` type    |
| `l` or `L` | (`signed`) `long` type   |
| `ul` or `uL` or `Ul` or `UL` | `unsigned long` type   |
| `long long` or `u11` or `U11` or `uLL` or `ULL` | `unsigned long long` type |

When using the suffixes to specify a type for integer literals, it is essential to follow the correct suffix to represent the intended data type accurately.

#### Float Literal Constant

In C++, all float literal constants are stored as floating point. All of these float-type literal constants are stored as type double, and we can directly specify the type to be stored by adding a suffix. The following table shows the float types that can be represented by adding a suffix in C++.

| Suffix | Type          |
|--------|---------------|
| `f` or `F` | `float` type    |
| Default| `double` type   |
| `l` or `L` | `long double` type |

When using the suffixes to specify the type for float literals, the default type without a suffix is double. Therefore, if we want to use a float literal, we should add the `'f'` or `'F'` suffix to it. For a long double literal, the `'l'` or `'L'` suffix should be added.

#### Pointer Literal Constants

A null pointer means a pointer that does not point to anything. Until now, in C++, a pointer was initialized to 0 to represent a null pointer. However, starting with C++11, it provides the `nullptr` keyword to represent a null pointer more appropriately than a zero-initialized null pointer.

The type of a literal constant using the `nullptr` keyword is a pointer type and cannot be converted to an integer type. We can still specify a null pointer in C++ using 0, so `nullptr == 0` returns true. However, using the `nullptr` literal constant can make our program safer.

#### Binary Literal Constants

From C++14, binary literal constants can be expressed using `0B` or a prefix of `0b` followed by a sequence of 0s and 1s.

```cpp
auto a = 0B010111;
```

The `auto` keyword is used to automatically deduce the type of the variable `a`.

### Symbolic Constants

A symbolic constant is a constant that has a name, just like a variable. Symbolic constants must be initialized at the time of declaration. These symbolic constants can be declared using macros or using the `const` keyword. However, since declarations using macros are specific to the C language, in C++, it's recommended to use the `const` keyword whenever possible.

The general way to create symbolic constants in C++ is as follows:
```cpp
const int num = 20;
```

As shown in the example above, constants using the `const` keyword must be initialized along with their declaration.

The advantages of symbolic constants using the `const` keyword over macro declarations are:
1. We can explicitly specify the type of a constant.
2. It can also be used for complex user-defined types such as structs.
3. We can restrict the usage of the symbolic constant to specific functions or files.
