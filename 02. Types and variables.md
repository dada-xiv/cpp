# Types and variables

## Variables for numbers

In C++, variables related to numeric expressions can be categorized into two main types: integer type variables and real number type variables. Integer type variables are further classified into four subtypes: `char`, `int`, `long`, and `long long` type variables. On the other hand, real number type variables are classified into two subtypes: `float` type and `double` type variables. These types are used to store decimal numbers with floating-point precision.

In addition to the built-in types, C++ also allows the creation of user-defined struct variables. Structs are used to group related data together, providing a way to process and manipulate them as a single unit.

## Constants

A constant, like a variable, is a memory space in which data can be stored. However, unlike variables, constants cannot change the data stored in memory while the program is running. In C++, constants can be divided into the following types according to how they are expressed:
1. Literal constant

2. Symbolic constant

## Integer type
## Float type
## Character type
## Bool type
## Floating point type
## Type conversion
