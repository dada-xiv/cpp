# Structs

Structs are user-defined data types that allow us to group multiple variables of different data types together under a single name. They are similar to classes but have some key differences, mainly regarding access control and member functions.

A struct is declared using the `struct` keyword, followed by the struct name and a pair of curly braces enclosing its members. Each member variable has a data type and a name.

```cpp
struct MyStruct {
    int member1;
    double member2;
    char member3;
};
```

## Initialization and accessing members

We can initialize struct instances during their declaration or later in the code using the uniform initialization syntax:

```cpp
MyStruct instance1 = {10, 3.14, 'A'};
MyStruct instance2;
instance2.member1 = 42;
instance2.member2 = 2.71;
instance2.member3 = 'B';
```
Struct members can be accessed using the dot (`.`) operator:

```cpp
int value = instance1.member1;
double pi = instance1.member2;
char letter = instance1.member3;
```

## Differences between Structs and Classes:
The primary differences between structs and classes in C++ are related to access control and default member visibility. In structs, all members are public by default, while in classes, they are private by default. Additionally, structs are commonly used for simple data containers, while classes are more suitable for encapsulating data and behavior together.

## Passing structs to functions

Structs can be passed to functions by value or by reference, just like any other data type:

```cpp
void displayStruct(MyStruct data) {
    // Function implementation
}

void modifyStruct(MyStruct& data) {
    // Function implementation
}
```
